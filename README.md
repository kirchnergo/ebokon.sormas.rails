# ebokon.sormas.rails

This is a prototypical implementation of a surveillance and **outbreak management** tool including *rumor exploration* and *contact tracing*.
It should help in understanding the simulations done in [ebokon.simulation](https://github.com/kirchnergo/ebokon.simulation).

It is **NOT** meant as a tool used in production!
